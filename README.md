# Litera (Adaptive Learning System for Writing)

## Developing a Personalised Learning Experience for Improving Writing Skills

### How to use

1. cd mysite
2. python manage.py runserver

### Problem

Traditional paradigms of a “one size fits all” educational approach in writing fall short in addressing the unique learning needs of students. This causes unstrategic learning outcomes that are frustrating for students and teachers alike.

### Solution

Modern adaptive learning systems tailor learning experiences to the unique needs of students to improve writing skills based on their learning preferences, topics of interest and writing abilities and style. The user journey is outlined below.

The system’s learning planning agent generates questions based on the learner’s knowledge and preferences. It then identifies gaps in the written submission and gives personalised feedback following a skills checklist:
1. Content-related skills (topic sentence, supporting sentences, appropriate conclusion, relevancy, adequacy of content)
2. Style-related skills (cohesion, coherence, word choice, expression quality, sentence structure variety) 
3. Spelling and punctuation
4. Grammar (verb tenses, phrasal verbs, prepositions, etc)
The mastery of writing skills is achieved through “levelling up” in meeting the skills checklist. Feedback includes recommending sample essays, resources such as videos or readings depending on learning styles and topics of interest, and suggesting ways to improve writing in the form of synonyms, sentence structure, and more.
